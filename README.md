# IoT Project - Smart Home

##Overview
This project is based on:
* **User interface** - A web application front end that will take commands from the user and notify him with current status of the appliances and important notifications.
* **Server** - a secure web application server that will communicate and control the different appliances based on predetermined logic.
* **Smart appliances** - full control of smart appliances based on predetermined logic. This will include microcontrollers such as Arduino.
